# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project is the *Rock, Paper, Scissors* game I did a while back using Command Line converted into an interactive game, where the player must choose one of the buttons (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

The CPU will choose a random button, and whomever has the stronger attack wins the round. Whomever wins 3 Rounds shall the declared the Winner of the Game.
