Introduction
---
When I first started my Frontend Journey, I used The Odin Project as my learning platform of choice. One of the earliest JavaScript exercises was to write Rock, Paper, Scissors using CL. 

Fast forward several months later, and I decided to revisit it by adding a graphic interface.

Updates Made
---

The previous version was made with Desktop in mind. I've updated it so that it will work on Mobile as well. 

In addition, I updated the UI to make it look nicer.

Tools I Used
---

* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla JavaScript

<br>

What I learned
---

Guess this is more of a "What I practiced", as I went wild with flexbox to get the layout to behave! ðŸ˜‹

<br>

Items for further study
---

I'm still diving into React, and once I'm a bit more versed in it, I would like to refactor everything with React in mind.

Also, make some more changes to the UI.
