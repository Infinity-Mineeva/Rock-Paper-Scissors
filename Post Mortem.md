This was a fun little side project to practive what I've learned so far. Though I originally did this in the Odin Project, it was all done via CL. It was interesting and fun to make it more interactive with the use of buttons.

**Challenges**

The things that took some sluthing to figure out:
- **Disabling Buttons:** I tried following the tutorial on w3 Schools, but it wasn't achieving the effect that I wanted. Styling the buttons was no problem, but I was still able to choose the other buttons after making my choice. I wanted it to be more like a radio button, where you could choose only one. I did find tutorials to help me not only to get the buttons to act like radio buttons, but to be properly disabled after making a choice.
- **Having CPU choose a new number when starting a new game:** I knew how to generate a random number, but took me a while to realize that I should've put the code into a function and call that function in the Rematch/Play Again events.
- **Adding/Removing Classes:** really need to brush up on this. Thought I remembered how, but I stumbled a bit on getting the class to be added or removed. Tried using Toggle, but didn't really work for me.

**Things to Improve**

I am proud for doing this from beginning to end instead of following a tutorial ðŸ˜Š That said, there are things I'd like to spruce up:

- **UI:** It's cute, but I think I could fix up the colour scheme. And different fonts, I thnk.
- **JS Code:** I'm still a bit unclear on when it's best to have my code in a function (I think I can make the player's pick into a function and call that). WIll have to read up on that more and refactor code as appropriate.
